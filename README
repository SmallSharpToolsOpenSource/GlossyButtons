This difference between this version and the original is that I wanted
to work in Interface Builder to manage my views. To do this all styling
for the text is done in IB and the background color for the button is
used as the drawing colors and the background color is then reset to 
clear. The samples in this project show that you can have multiple
buttons with different colors and sizes as well as different styles
for the button label.

To use in your own project you just need the GBGlossyButton class
and then set the class if your UIButton in IB to GBGlossyButton.
InitWithCoder will read your background color and use it from there.

You can set the color later as well if you choose and the button
will change to the given color.
